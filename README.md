# Create-WinImage-From-Folder
Create a bootable Windows image from Windows files in a folder

Current Version: 1.09  
Release Date: Sep 9, 2021  

This batch file takes the contents of Windows boot media that has been expanded to a folder on a HDD, SSD, or removable media, and creates a new bootable ISO image from these files. This can be helpful if you are making changes to any of the Windows files and then want to recreate an image from the modified files.

NOTE: For a more full featured program that includes the functionality of this batch file, please see my WIM-Tools project (www.github.com/hsehestedt/WIM-Tools). This batch file duplicates a small portion of the functionality of one routine in that program and is especially useful for those who may want to dissect the batch file to see how it works under the hood.
